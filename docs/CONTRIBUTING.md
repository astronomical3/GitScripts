## Rules for Contributing:
1. Read the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
2. In addition to what is already known to be inappropriate behavior, as per the Code of Conduct, it is also imperative that you refrain from anti-neurodivergent sentiment.  That is any sentiment or action that is done to deprive neurodivergent people (Autistic, ADHDer, Dyslexic, Dyscalculic, Dyspraxic, Dysgraphic, Tourette's, etc.) of their human freedoms and their dignity.
3. Examples of anti-neurodivergent sentiment:

    a. Using the "r-word" (of course, it's ableist in general).
    
    b. Boasting support for non-autistic led "autism advocacy organizations" (e.g. Autism Speaks) or their events or programs (e.g. Light It Up Blue, genetic epidemiology and research on autism, support of ABA therapy, support for Google's AUT10K program, etc.).
    
    c. Showing off the puzzle piece logo or puzzle piece ribbon for "autism awareness".
    
    d. Calling neurodivergent people ("people with Autism", "people with ADHD", "people with dyslexia/dyscalculia/dyspraxia/dysgraphia", "people with Tourette's", etc.).  Instead, please call us "Autistic people", "ADHDers", "Dyslexic people"... you get the gist now, right?
    
    e. Attempting to talk down neurodivergent people to block them from discussing their ideas, concerns, or problems with the project at hand.
    
    f. Not allowing neurodivergent people to discuss and/or contribute to the project at all.
    
    g. Outing someone as neurodivergent without their explicit consent, including your own family members or friends, publicly via Discussions, Issues, Pull Requests, etc.
    
    h. Minimizing neurodivergent people's struggles ("We're all a little Autistic", "But you have superpowers, why are you facing such struggle?", "You're an inspiration", etc.).
    
    i. Mocking people with mental health problems (whether they are neurodivergent or not, it's just plain wrong).
    
    ***If you witness or experience any of these incidents, please reach out to me via [Incidents](https://github.com/astronomical3/GitScripts/discussions/categories/incidents) in Discussions, or my email, astrobrunner@gmail.com. Such sentiment will be met first with correction, but if done the second or third time, I will kick you out of direct contributing, or ask you to leave the chats.***
